All the poems, I love.

## Haikus

### *by Bashō*

##### An old silent pond...

> An old silent pond...  
> A frog jumps into the pond,  
> splash! Silence again.  

##### No one travels

> No one travels  
> Along this way but I,  
> This autumn evening.  

##### From time to time

> From time to time  
> The clouds give rest  
> To the moon-beholders.
